I think the patience has been the disproportionate component of my success
People should stop complaining People should figure out who they are They should be tripling down on what they’re good at They should be competent in certain areas but you’re not gonna become Beyonce or you know like your bone structure is a certain way Like you’re not gonna solve everything Your IQ can get a little bit better but don’t worry about the incremental
Figure out what puts you on fire and you’re halfway decent at If you’re lucky enough right now to be reading and you’re good at what you like become tunnel vision Because there‘s way too many voices telling you what and how and here’s the other thing and this is the big one have the conversation with the person that’s holding you back The reason most people who are reading right now are not doing that thing is they’re worried about the opinion of somebody Usually their mother Usually their father And the reality is is that your spouse maybe the person holding you back and you have to have that conversation We have to get to a place where you’re doing you because the number one thing that scares the fuck out of me is regret
And you’re gonna sit at 72 and you’re gonna say I wish I wish I wish and whether that’s money or spend more time with your family there’re million ways to do this Not everyone wants to buy the Jets Not everybody wants to smoke weed on the beach in Bahamas Like everybody’s got a different fucking thing Figure out what your fucking thing is and stop making fucking bullshit excuses Who the president is your mom did this like I missed it I had that idea for uber Then why didn’t you fucking do it? There’s a reason that guys and gals like me continue to have audiences because people wanna be motivated to go and do things or they wanna learn tactics to go and do things Whether I’m giving you tactical advice like filters on snapchat or Facebook Ads or Instagram story collaborations or I’m motivating you through my words because I communicate that way or through my actions seeing this wake up at five
If everybody who’s reading this actually did something about it and then went on the course of their version of it then they wouldn’t be reading this And I genuinely know at the bottom of my heart out of all the people that wanna build audiences that I’m the complete opposite of almost all of them because 99% of those who produce content like this that are out there like I am the business of being that is what they are I have businesses I don’t need your 14 bucks for my books or to be in my course or this and that So I don’t need to monetize you So I then genuinely want you to never read or watch my content again The problem is every time you guys are posting do you know how many times I see on my on my Instagram oh I needed this today? And you know how many times I see that person nine months later still hanging around? If you needed it then take it and do something about it The reason there’s gonna be a billion motivational views today on YouTube is that people love the feeling of being motivated they don’t like putting in the work to do something about the feeling I hate the motivation me until you do something about it It’s time
I'm excited that Snapchat happened. I'm excited that M 100 percent. I'm okay with that, I'm okay with that. As a matter of fact, the fund that I'm working on right now to close is gonna be more later stage, because I've realized I'm better there! Because when I was yelling about Snapchat in 2013, that thing was stuck at number 30 in the app store for a year and then I was looking deeper, I was like, this has not plateaued, this is just beginning. That was just a billion dollar valuation then. I'd be sitting very happy with 20x-ing my money right now, and way more assured that it was gonna win, more so than the hundreds of startups that I invested in for the idea and gut feel for the entrepreneur.usical.ly might happen. I'm excited that even though I'm 40, I don’t feel like I'm gonna lose touch with 13 year olds and 70 year olds, as long as there are always gonna be new things that can capture the world's attention and hit scale because the internet is now at scale, I feel like I get to play. So there's nothing specific over the next six months, it was that I needed something to come along post-Facebook and in social media to make me feel like this game would go for a long time, and that was called Instagram and Snapchat, and now there's one that's kind of making some noise called Musical.ly, so I love that this game — I wanna be old and crusty and look like Yoda and be like, I told you! It was gonna be shooga-booga! And so that's my dream, that I get to keep playing this consumer arbitrage of attention: Where does everyone think it is but I actually know it’s over here.
100 percent. I'm okay with that, I'm okay with that. As a matter of fact, the fund that I'm working on right now to close is gonna be more later stage, because I've realized I'm better there!
